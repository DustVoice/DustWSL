Although _nushell_ provides us with some good scripting ability, as many shells do,
I sometimes feel myself drawn to some other languages for my scripting needs.

Today, I mainly use [Clojure](https://clojure.org/index), or rather [Babashka](https://babashka.org),
for more advanced projects in conjunction with [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) and sometimes [neil](https://github.com/babashka/neil).

For some scripts, [Julia](https://julialang.org) is very nice, has a good ecosystem and I like it more than the snake.

I'm currently also trying out [Janet](https://janet-lang.org), some features and properties are very intriguing for a system scripting language,
but the ecosystem isn't as mature.

I also sometimes feel like contorting myself, or in other words using [Python](https://www.python.org), though I try to use [PyPy](https://pypy.org).
Not giving up on my lispy dreams, I'm trying out [Hy](https://hylang.org) with that.

<Aside>

I also considered using [xonsh](https://xon.sh) (maybe also with [coconut](https://coconut-lang.org)) as my main shell,
but bad `nvim` support forces me to stay with `nu` at the moment,
despite me fixing the weird slowdown issues with _xonsh_ by removing all `/mnt/c` paths from `$PATH`.

For a UNIX system, all Windows files (`/mnt/c`) have the executable bit set,
so when WSL appends the Windows paths to `$PATH`, like e.g. `C:\Windows\System32`,
`xonsh` thinks they're all executables.
In reality, only `.exe`s are executable but `xonsh` isn't interested in that fact,
causing massive slowdowns and hiccups, especially when using `prompt-toolkit`.
