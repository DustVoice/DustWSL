For easy file editing, I'm going to use [`neovim`](https://neovim.io), so editing is as simple as calling `nvim` on the file.

<Aside>

I _will_ install `emacs` later in the [Optional section](../opt) (although I mainly use `nvim` nowadays),
but in order for me to not bite into my desk, I _will_ also need my _doomed_ config for that,
which means it is a more elaborate setup.

</Aside>

## General tools

It is always a good idea to have
[wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/),
[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and
[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) installed,
but with my Neovim config it's even more important,
as [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) and other plugins make heavy use of them.

## Additional tools

<Card title="Tree-sitter">

As my Neovim config also includes [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) support,
you need to have some kind of C/C++ compiler available.
Normally Arch Linux on WSL2 should come with `gcc`.
The `tree-sitter` binary isn't required normally, but it's nice to have available just in case.

<Card title="lazyjj">

As I use `jj`, I also want to install `lazyjj`, as it provides some integration for AstroNvim.

## Clipboard integration

For Neovim's clipboard integration, you kind of have to decide whether or not you want native clipboard integration with Wayland/X11.
As a rough measure, you probably want clipboard integration over Windows if you use e.g. WezTerm installed on Windows to access WSL
and you probably want native clipboard integration for Wayland/X11 if you use an installation of WezTerm from out of WSL.

<Card title="Clipboard via Windows">

Simply install [win32yank](https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank) on the Windows side.
As Windows paths are normally appended to the WSL path, it is available to `nvim` within WSL, if you have it on your Windows path.
To simplify this, simply install it using `scoop`

```ps
scoop.exe install win32yank

```

</Card>
<Card title="Native clipboard">

Install both [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard),
as well as [xsel](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/).
I use Wayland primarily, but it doesn't hurt to have both available,
as Neovim checks for wl-clipboard first anyway (see `:help clipboard`).

<Aside type="caution">

If you follow the steps for **Xonsh** in the next chapter, you might choose to remove the Windows `PATH` from Xonsh's `$PATH`.

This causes you to loose access to the `win32yank.exe` executable, as well as `clip.exe` used by Xonsh's `prompt-toolkit`.
You will therefore either need to use WezTerm from within WSL, together with the native option above,
or manually add the aforementioned executables to Xonsh's `$PATH`.
