## Editor

For easy file editing, I'm going to use [`neovim`](https://neovim.io), so editing is as simple as calling `nvim` on the file.

<Aside>

I _will_ install `emacs` later in the [Optional section](../opt) (although I mainly use `nvim` nowadays),
but in order for me to not bite into my desk, I _will_ also need my _doomed_ config for that,
which means it is a more elaborate setup.

</Aside>

It is always a good idea to have
[wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/),
[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and
[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) installed,
but with my Neovim config it's even more important,
as [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) and other plugins make heavy use of them.

For clipboard integration, I'm installing both [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard),
as well as [xsel](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/).
I use Wayland primarily, but it doesn't hurt to have both available,
as Neovim checks for wl-clipboard first anyway (see `:help clipboard`).

<Aside type="tip">

Just as a fallback, it might be wise to also install [win32yank](https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank) on the Windows side.
As Windows paths are normally appended to the WSL path, it is available to `nvim` within WSL, if you have it on your Windows path.
To simplify this, simply install it using `scoop`

```ps
scoop.exe install win32yank

```

</Aside>

As my Neovim config also includes [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) support,
you need to have some kind of C/C++ compiler available.
Normally Arch Linux on WSL2 should come with `gcc`.
The `tree-sitter` binary isn't required normally, but it's nice to have available just in case.

Also some LSPs, require `node` and `npm` for installing the language servers.
By installing them now, before opening neovim, we make sure it doesn't accidentally pick up any Windows `npm`.
Trust me, you'll never get back the day you spent troubleshooting some weird LSP errors due to `npm` not being WSL-native.

Some plugins require Python 3, so we're also going to install that.

If we want to edit the Neovim config, we also need tools for Lua, namely `luarocks`.

As I use `jj`, I also want to install `lazyjj`, as it provides some integration for AstroNvim.
