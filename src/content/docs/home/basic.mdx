First off, we need to install some basic tools to be able to set up the [dotfiles](./dotter) correctly.

## AUR with `paru`

<Steps>

1. First install `git`, so we can grab an [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org) helper named [`paru`](https://github.com/morganamilo/paru).

   ```sh
   sudo pacman -S git
   ```

2. In order for us to install this package in a second, we also need the `base-devel` package group

   ```sh
   sudo pacman -S base-devel
   ```

3. Now clone the repository `paru-bin` from _AUR_ (this way we don't need to compile it),
   as well as build and install it.

   ```sh
   git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru-bin.git
   cd paru-bin
   makepkg -si
   ```

4. You can now remove the `~/paru-bin` directory, as `paru` is able to manage/update itself.

5. From now on we can simply substitute `pacman` with `paru`.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  `paru` is **not** supposed to be run with **root** privileges. You shouldn't
  use `sudo paru`! Paru will invoke a `sudo` prompt on its own!

  <Aside type="tip">
    If you expect `paru` to take longer between `sudo` invocations than the timeout,
    you can use the `--sudoloop` option to keep `sudo` from timeouting.

## Editor

For easy file editing, I'm going to use [`neovim`](https://neovim.io), so editing is as simple as calling `nvim` on the file.

```sh
sudo pacman -S neovim
```

<Aside>
  I _will_ install `emacs` later in the [Optional section](../opt) (although I
  mainly use `nvim` nowadays), but in order for me to not bite into my desk, I
  _will_ also need my _doomed_ config for that, which means it is a more
  elaborate setup.
</Aside>

## SSH

In order to switch to `ssh` URLs later in this document (e.g. for my dotfiles repo),
we of course need to install it with the [`openssh`](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/openssh/) package.

```sh
sudo pacman -S openssh
```
