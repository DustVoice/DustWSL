In this part I set up my `$HOME` directory and environment, with all the basic tools
needed to actually be able to use WSL.

Note that some sections in the following chapters are seperated into a _Xonsh_ and _Nushell_ tab.
Select the one corresponding to the shell you wanna use.

<Tabs syncKey="shell">

<TabItem label="Nushell">

I use `nu`.

Follow these tabs, if you want to use `nu`, too.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Xonsh">

I previously tried `xonsh`, although I noticed several things that led me back to Nushell:

In theory, it is nice to be inside a python-esque environment.
In practice, though, I can't really use `conda` environments, as I install it as a system package,
neither did it work well with `nvim` and/or the [conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure) plugin.

I found myself missing the ease of `nu`'s `ls | sort-by modified` syntax.

Furthermore, I'm at a point where I thing it's better to transition from a quick and dirty `.nu` script to an entirely different language,
be it Python, Babashka/Clojure, or similar,
than to struggle with the limitations of a Python superset in the form of `.xsh` files.

Bad editor support, no good REPL workflow and many more nuisances made me switch back.

Follow these tabs, if you want to use `xonsh` anyways.
