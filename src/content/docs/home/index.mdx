import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

In this part I set up my `$HOME` directory and environment, with all the basic tools
needed to actually be able to use WSL.

Note that some sections in the following chapters are seperated into a _Xonsh_ and _Nushell_ tab.
Select the one corresponding to the shell you wanna use.

<Tabs syncKey="shell">

<TabItem label="Xonsh">

I currently use `xonsh`. Follow these tabs, if you want to use `xonsh`, too.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Nushell">

I previously used `nu`. Follow these tabs, if you want to use `nu`, too.

</TabItem>
