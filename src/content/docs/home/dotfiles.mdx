To manage my dotfiles, I'm currently using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io).

Before we can use the dotfiles we need to download them first, duh.

<Tabs syncKey="vc">

<TabItem label="native">

It's literally one line (changing the argument to your GitHub username if you maintain a fork):

```sh "DustVoice"
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply DustVoice
```

<Aside type="tip">

If you want to use chezmoi installed as a system package, instead of locally by this script

<Steps>

1. Install [chezmoi](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/chezmoi/)

2. Init chezmoi and directly apply the changes (again changing the argument to your GitHub username if you maintain a fork)

   ```sh "DustVoice"
   chezmoi init DustVoice --apply
   ```

</Steps>

I'm using [jj](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) currently,
and will therefore use it to clone and make changes to my dotfiles repository.

This means we can't use an one-liner, however. Instead follow these steps

<Steps>

1.  Make sure the target directory exists

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share
    ```

2.  Clone the repository to `~/.local/share/chezmoi` (changing the URL to you GitHub username if you maintain a fork).

    ```sh "DustVoice"
    jj git clone --colocate https://github.com/DustVoice/dotfiles.git ~/.local/share/chezmoi
    ```

    <Aside>

    Cloning the repository is first done using its `https` URL, as using `ssh` with my Yubikey requires my dotfiles to already be setup.
    As circular dependencies are a **lot** of fun <sub>not</sub>, I will simply change the remote URL later to use `ssh`.

    </Aside>

3.  Initialize and apply the dotfiles

    ```sh
    chezmoi init --apply
    ```

4.  Create chezmoi's config file at `~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml`, changing the default `git pull` command to use `jj`.

    ```toml title="~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml" ins={1-3} "nu"
    [update]
    command = "nu"
    args = ["-c", "jj git fetch; jj rebase -d main@origin"]
    ```

    <Aside>

    You can in also skip this step.
    You can then simply do a `chezmoi cd` and run `jj` commands from within the repository, like you're used to and `exit` out once you're finished.

    For that you probably want to make `nu` chezmoi's default `cd` command

    ```toml title="~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml" ins={1-2} "nu"
    [cd]
    command = "nu"
    ```

    Also, if you're not planning to use `nu`shell like me, you might want to substitute the command according to your shell's syntax.

    As the `jj` repository is initialized as a colocated repository,
    `git pull`/`chezmoi update` would in theory work with `jj`, too, but you might need to update/rebase any changes afterwards.
