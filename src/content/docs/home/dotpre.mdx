Before we can use the dotfiles we need to download them first, duh.

<Card title="jujutsu">

As I'm using [jj](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) currently,
I personally will use it to clone my dotfiles repository.
As `jj` doesn't support _gitmodules_ however,
I will still need to use `git` for that until I change this dependency.

<Aside>

You can still use `git` however, as `jj` uses `git` under the hood normally.

Cloning the repository will first be done using its `https` URL, as using `ssh` with my Yubikey requires my dotfiles to already be setup.
As circular dependencies are a **lot** of fun <sub>not</sub>, I will simply change the remote URL later to use `ssh`.

```sh
jj git clone --colocate https://github.com/DustVoice/dotfiles.git
```

The only thing left to do is initialize the submodules

<Aside>

As `jj` has no concepts of `git` submodules (yet), we can simply use the most recent commit of the modules (`--remote`).

</Aside>

```sh frame="terminal" title="~/dotfiles"
git submodule update --init --remote
```

<Aside type="caution">

Unfortunately there are open issues with `jj`, due to its usage of `libgit2`, which cause problems when behind a proxy, or other unusual network setups.
This is a known issue and until there are some decisions made upstream on how to proceed, be it changing libraries, or shelling out to `git`,
[bnjmnt4n](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n) maintains a [fork](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n/jj/tree/ssh-openssh) and proposed a [PR](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/pull/3191),
where he switched to OpenSSH, mitigating several of these issues.

It is easily installed using `cargo`, although you need to actually have it set up (see the [Rust](opt/rust) chapter for that).

Note that you should have [CMake](https://cmake.org) installed.

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/bnjmnt4n/jj.git --branch ssh-openssh --locked --bin jj jj-cli --features vendored-openssl
```

Of course you would now also uninstall the `jujutsu` system package.
