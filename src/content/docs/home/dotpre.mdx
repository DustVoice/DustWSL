Before we can use the dotfiles we need to download them first, duh.

<Card title="jujutsu">

As I'm using [jj](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) currently,
I personally will use it to clone my dotfiles repository.
As `jj` doesn't support _gitmodules_ however,
I will still need to use `git` for that until I change this dependency.

<Aside>

You can still use `git` however, as `jj` uses `git` under the hood normally.

Cloning the repository will first be done using its `https` URL, as using `ssh` with my Yubikey requires my dotfiles to already be setup.
As circular dependencies are a **lot** of fun <sub>not</sub>, I will simply change the remote URL later to use `ssh`.

```sh
jj git clone --colocate https://github.com/DustVoice/dotfiles.git
```

The only thing left to do is initialize the submodules

<Aside>

As `jj` has no concepts of `git` submodules (yet), we can simply use the most recent commit of the modules (`--remote`).

</Aside>

```sh
git submodule update --init --remote
```
