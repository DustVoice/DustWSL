Before we proceed further, I will quickly install my shell next, so I don't go insane from using `bash`.
Of course, you can use any shell you want.
In my case, I'll be using [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh).

I am using `nu` because of its nice functionality<sup>read: I use `rust` btw</sup>.

## Set it as default

If you remember correctly, we set the login shell to `bash` when creating the custom user,
so you might wonder why we didn't directly set it to `nu`.

Well nushell **isn't POSIX compliant**, and neither does it want to be.
Therefore running `nu` as a login shell might not be the absolute best experience you'll ever have.

Instead, we populate the `.bashrc` with some scripting that will let `nu` take over any _interactive_ shell,
while scripts, etc. that expect a `POSIX` compliant shell can have their way.

```bash title=~/.bashrc wrap ins={1-4}
if [[ $- == *i* && $(ps --no-header --pid $PPID --format comm) != "nu" && -z ${BASH_EXECUTION_STRING} ]] then
  exec nu
fi
```

## Special case for WezTerm

I'm using the terminal emulator [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) to run WSL.
There is a weird behaviour however with nushell, where a `\n` gets inserted above the prompt on every keystroke.

If you look inside `~/.config/nushell/config.nu`

```nu title=~/.config/nushell/config.nu '("wezterm_pane" not-in $env)' collapse={2-9, 17-27} showLineNumbers startLineNumber=240
    shell_integration: {
        # osc2 abbreviates the path if in the home_dir, sets the tab/window title, shows the running command in the tab/window title
        osc2: true
        # osc7 is a way to communicate the path to the terminal, this is helpful for spawning new tabs in the same directory
        osc7: true
        # osc8 is also implemented as the deprecated setting ls.show_clickable_links, it shows clickable links in ls output if your terminal supports it. show_clickable_links is deprecated in favor of osc8
        osc8: true
        # osc9_9 is from ConEmu and is starting to get wider support. It's similar to osc7 in that it communicates the path to the terminal
        osc9_9: false
        # osc133 is several escapes invented by Final Term which include the supported ones below.
        # 133;A - Mark prompt start
        # 133;B - Mark prompt end
        # 133;C - Mark pre-execution
        # 133;D;exit - Mark execution finished with exit code
        # This is used to enable terminals to know where the prompt is, the command is, where the command finishes, and where the output of the command is
        osc133: ("WEZTERM_PANE" not-in $env)
        # osc633 is closely related to osc133 but only exists in visual studio code (vscode) and supports their shell integration features
        # 633;A - Mark prompt start
        # 633;B - Mark prompt end
        # 633;C - Mark pre-execution
        # 633;D;exit - Mark execution finished with exit code
        # 633;E - NOT IMPLEMENTED - Explicitly set the command line with an optional nonce
        # 633;P;Cwd=<path> - Mark the current working directory and communicate it to the terminal
        # and also helps with the run recent menu in vscode
        osc633: true
        # reset_application_mode is escape \x1b[?1l and was added to help ssh work better
        reset_application_mode: true
    }
```

`osc133` is disabled while using WezTerm, mitigating the aformentioned issue.

This works flawlessly in windows, but unfortunately `wezterm_pane` isn't automatically set within wsl.

To _hack_ this, i just added an `export` to my `~/.bashrc`

```sh ins={1} title=~/.bashrc
export wezterm_pane=0
```
