Before we proceed further, I will quickly install my shell next, so I don't go insane from using `bash`.
Of course, you can use any shell you want.

<Tabs syncKey="shell">

<TabItem label="Nushell">

In this case we're using `nu` <sup>Just say it: I use `rust` btw</sup>.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Xonsh">

In this case, we'll be using [xonsh](https://xon.sh).

<Aside>

In my custom `~/.config/xonsh/rc.xsh`, which gets deployed by dotter,
I source some additional files, if present, in the same directory (`~/.config/xonsh`).

<FileTree>

- ~
  - .config/xonsh
    - **alias.xsh** Custom **aliases**
    - **env.xsh** **$PATH** / other env-vars
    - rc.xsh Main **config** file _(managed by dotfiles)_
    - **user.xsh** Custom **code** _(not managed by dotfiles)_
  - .xonshrc Managed by **conda init**

</FileTree>

<Aside type="tip">

A good code snippet for prepending multiple items, as `$PATH.extend([...])` appends the items, would be

```python title="~/.config/xonsh/env.xsh" ins={1} "..."
[$PATH.prepend(path) for path in ["~/.local/bin", ...]]
```

<Aside type="tip">

There are some [known slowdown issues](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3895) with _xonsh_.
For a UNIX system, all Windows files (`/mnt/c`) have the executable bit set,
so when WSL appends the Windows paths to `$PATH`, like e.g. `C:\Windows\System32`,
`xonsh` thinks they're all executables.
In reality, only `.exe`s are executable but `xonsh` isn't interested in that fact,
causing massive slowdowns and hiccups, especially when using `prompt-toolkit`.

You can mitigate this issue by

- manually removing all `/mnt/c` paths from `$PATH` in the Xonsh init file

  ```python title="~/.config/xonsh/user.xsh" ins={1} "/mnt/c"
  [$PATH.remove(path) for path in $PATH.paths if path.startswith("/mnt/c/")]
  ```

  (the `user.xsh` file gets loaded by my Xonsh `rc.xsh` file)

- disabling the addition of the Windows `PATH` for this WSL distribution

  ```config title="/etc/wsl.conf" ins={1-2} "/mnt/c"
  [Interop]
  appendWindowsPath = False
  ```

This causes you to loose access to the `win32yank.exe` executable, however,
as well as `clip.exe` used by Xonsh's `prompt-toolkit`.
You will therefore either need to use Wezterm from within WSL, together with the native option above,
or manually add the aforementioned executables to Xonsh's `$PATH`.

<Steps>

1.  Add `win32yank.exe` to the `env.xsh` file

    ```python title="~/.config/xonsh/env.xsh" ins={1,3} "<username>"
    windows = ["/mnt/c/Users/<username>/scoop/apps/win32yank/current"]

    $PATH.extend(windows)
    ```

2.  ```sh
    sudo ln -s /mnt/c/Windows/System32/clip.exe /usr/bin/clip.exe
    ```

## Install missing tools

To properly utilize my shell setup, I need to have the following tools available

- [carapace-bin](https://github.com/carapace-sh/carapace-bin/) (command completer),
- [starship](https://starship.rs) (prompt),
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) (smarter `cd`)
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) (better `ls`)

<Tabs syncKey="shell">

<TabItem label="Nushell">

<Aside type="tip">

As Nushell currently doesn't have a built-in solution for background tasks,
I am personally often using [Zellij](https://zellij.dev).

My dotfiles also integrate [pueue](https://github.com/Nukesor/pueue),
utilizing [`task.nu`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/modules/background_task/task.nu),
according to the [official book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/background_task.html).
After installing pueue, you simply need a quick

```sh
systemctl --user enable pueued
systemctl --user start pueued
```

to get started.

I would definitely recommend installing [prompt_toolkit](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/python-prompt_toolkit/),
While you're at it, it shouldn't be too hard to install [pygments](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/python-pygments/)
and [setproctitle](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/python-setproctitle/), too.

## Special case for WezTerm

<Tabs syncKey="shell">

<TabItem label="Nushell">

I'm using the terminal emulator [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) to run WSL.
There is a weird behaviour however with nushell, where a `\n` gets inserted above the prompt on every keystroke.

If you look inside `~/.config/nushell/config.nu`

```nu title=~/.config/nushell/config.nu '("WEZTERM_PANE" not-in $env)'
$env.config.shell_integration.osc133 = ("WEZTERM_PANE" not-in $env)
```

`osc133` is disabled while using WezTerm, mitigating the aformentioned issue.

This works flawlessly in windows, but unfortunately `wezterm_pane` isn't automatically set within wsl.

To _hack_ this, i just add an `export` to my `~/.bashrc`, which gets sourced by my dotfiles' `~/.bash_profile`

```sh ins={1} title=~/.bashrc
export WEZTERM_PANE=0
```

<Aside type="tip">

You could theoretically install `wezterm` under WSL and use it that way,
but I prefer to launch WSL through Wezterm's domain funcionality (domain `"WSL:Arch"`) from Windows,
as fullscreen isn't working correctly with Wayland and WSLg for me.

<TabItem label="Xonsh">

Nothing special to do for Xonsh, as far as I'm aware.

## Set it as default

<Tabs syncKey="shell">

<TabItem label="Nushell">

If you remember correctly, we set the login shell to `bash` when creating the custom user,
so you might wonder why we didn't directly set it to `nu`.

Well nushell **isn't POSIX compliant**, and neither does it want to be.
Therefore running `nu` as a login shell might not be the absolute best experience you'll ever have.

Instead, I include a code snippet in my dotfile's `~/.bash_profile` that will let `nu` take over any _interactive_ shell,
while scripts, etc. that expect a `POSIX` compliant shell can have their way.

```bash title=~/.bash_profile "exec nu"
if [[ $- == *i* && $(ps --no-header --pid $PPID --format comm) != "nu" && -z ${BASH_EXECUTION_STRING} ]] then
  exec nu
fi
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Xonsh">

<Steps>

1.  Make sure that `xonsh` is listed in `/etc/shells` (or add it)

    ```txt title=/etc/shells wrap {1}
    /usr/bin/xonsh
    ```

2.  Set your login shell

    ```sh
    chsh -s /usr/bin/xonsh
    ```
