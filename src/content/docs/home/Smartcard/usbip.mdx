We simply need to install the [`usbipd-win`](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) software on our Windows machine.

Make sure to reopen any shell/terminal and check that `uspipd.exe` is available on your `PATH`.

<Aside>
  You will probably need to perform the next step with elevated rights. Either
  open e.g. PowerShell as an Administrator, or install [`sudo` from
  `scoop`](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=sudo) for example.
</Aside>

We can now easily list available devices using

```sh
usbipd.exe list
```

Take note of the `BUSID` of the desired (smartcard) device.

<Aside type="tip">
  You can also use the _Hardware ID_ (`VID:PID` column) by using the `-i` flag
  instead of the `-b` one.
</Aside>

Then simply execute

```sh "BUSID"
usbipd.exe bind -b BUSID
```

replacing `BUSID` with the one you took note of earlier.

<Aside>
  It can be necessary to _force_ this operation with the `-f` flag, in which
  case the device will be unavailable under Windows until you perform an
  `unbind`.
</Aside>

Now the only thing left to do is attaching the smartcard to WSL

```sh "BUSID"
usbipd.exe attach --wsl -b BUSID
```

<Aside>
The `bind` procedure is persistent between reboots.
The `attach` procedure however isn't, necessitating a reattachement.

This also means forcing the `bind` using `-f` makes it unavailable _until_ you explicitly do an `unbind`,
when `attach` on the contrary, reinstates control to Windows whenever the device is no longer connected to WSL.

</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  You can easily check if this worked by observing the `usbipd.exe` command
  output or by utilizing `lsusb` from the
  [`usbutils`](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/usbutils/) package.
