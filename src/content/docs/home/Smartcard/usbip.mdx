We simply need to install the [`usbipd-win`](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) software on our Windows machine.

Make sure to reopen any shell/terminal and check that `uspipd.exe` is available on your `PATH`.

<Aside type="tip">

You might need to perform the next step with elevated rights.
Either open _WSL USB_ / _PowerShell_ as an Administrator, or install [`sudo` from `scoop`](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=sudo) for example:

```ps
scoop.exe install sudo
```

</Aside>

## GUI

The process can be greatly simplified, by installing [wsl-usb-gui](https://gitlab.com/alelec/wsl-usb-gui) (shortcut is called **WSL USB**) on the Windows side.
You can do everything you desire from within the GUI, even set up auto attachments, without a hassle.

## CLI

First, list available devices using

```ps
usbipd.exe list
```

Take note of the `BUSID` of the desired (smartcard) device.

<Aside type="tip">
  
You can also use the _Hardware ID_ (`VID:PID` column) by using the `-i` flag instead of the `-b` one.

</Aside>

Then simply execute

```ps "BUSID"
usbipd.exe bind -b BUSID
```

replacing `BUSID` with the one you took note of earlier.

<Aside>

It can be necessary to _force_ this operation with the `-f` flag,
in which case the device will be unavailable under Windows until you perform an `unbind`.

</Aside>

Now the only thing left to do is attaching the smartcard to WSL

```ps "BUSID"
usbipd.exe attach -w -b BUSID
```

You can even have it auto-attached with

```ps "BUSID"
usbipd.exe attach -w -a -b BUSID
```

<Aside>

The `bind` procedure is persistent between reboots.
The `attach` procedure however isn't, necessitating a reattachement.

This also means forcing the `bind` using `-f` makes it unavailable _until_ you explicitly do an `unbind`,
when `attach` on the contrary, reinstates control to Windows whenever the device is no longer connected to WSL.

</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">

You can easily check if this worked by observing the `usbipd.exe` command output,
or by utilizing `lsusb` from the [`usbutils`](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/usbutils/) package.
