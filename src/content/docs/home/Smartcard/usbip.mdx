We simply need to install the [`usbipd-win`](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) software on our Windows machine.

Make sure to reopen any shell/terminal and check that `uspipd.exe` is available on your `PATH`.

<Aside type="tip">

You might need to perform the next step with elevated rights.
Either open _WSL USB_ / _PowerShell_ as an Administrator, or install [`sudo` from `scoop`](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=sudo) for example:

```ps
scoop.exe install sudo
```

</Aside>

## GUI

The process can be greatly simplified, by installing [wsl-usb-gui](https://gitlab.com/alelec/wsl-usb-gui) (shortcut is called **WSL USB**) on the Windows side.
You can do everything you desire from within the GUI, even set up auto attachments, without a hassle.

## CLI

First, list available devices using

```ps
usbipd.exe list
```

Take note of the `BUSID` of the desired (smartcard) device.

<Aside type="tip">
  
You can also use the _Hardware ID_ (`VID:PID` column) by using the `-i` flag instead of the `-b` one.

</Aside>

Then simply execute

```ps "BUSID"
usbipd.exe bind -b BUSID
```

replacing `BUSID` with the one you took note of earlier.

<Aside>

It can be necessary to _force_ this operation with the `-f` flag,
in which case the device will be unavailable under Windows until you perform an `unbind`.

</Aside>

Now the only thing left to do is attaching the smartcard to WSL

```ps "BUSID"
usbipd.exe attach -w -b BUSID
```

You can even have it auto-attached with

```ps "BUSID"
usbipd.exe attach -w -a -b BUSID
```

<Aside>

The `bind` procedure is persistent between reboots.
The `attach` procedure however isn't, necessitating a reattachement.

This also means forcing the `bind` using `-f` makes it unavailable _until_ you explicitly do an `unbind`,
when `attach` on the contrary, reinstates control to Windows whenever the device is no longer connected to WSL.

</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">

You can easily check if this worked by observing the `usbipd.exe` command output,
or by utilizing `lsusb` from the [`usbutils`](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/usbutils/) package.

</Aside>

## FIDO2

Despite all this, some utilities, for example `ssh-keygen`,
utilize a direct smartcard access using e.g. the `/dev/hidraw` devices the USB/IP setup produces.

For that to work, you simply need to add an `udev` rule

```text title="/etc/udev/rules.d/99-yubikey.rules" "1050" "0406" ins={1}
KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", GROUP="plugdev", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1050", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0406"
```

You might need to change the vendor and/or product ID.
You can easily check the IDs using the

```sh
lsusb
```

command.

Simply locate the Yubikey line in the output, and locate the IDs following the pattern: `[Bus IDs]: ID <vendor>:<product> [Name of the device]`

After that add your user to the `plugdev` group, restart WSL and you should be good to go.

```sh "<username>"
sudo groupadd plugdev
sudo usermod -aG plugdev <username>
```
