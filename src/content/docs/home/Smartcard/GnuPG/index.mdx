To now actually use the YubiKey, I need to make sure it works with `gpg`.
However we are presented with a couple issues, as explained in the following parts.

<Aside type="tip">

In case we use an _X session_, it might be smart to tell `gpg` what TTY we're on
by simply adding the following lines to the appropriate init file

<Tabs syncKey="shell">

<TabItem label="Xonsh">

```py title=~/.config/xonsh/user.xsh ins={1-2}
$GPG_TTY = $(tty)
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye >/dev/null
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Nushell">

```bash title=~/.bashrc ins={1-2}
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye >/dev/null
```

</TabItem>

<Aside type="caution" title="Wrong permissions">

Unfortunately, `dotter` doesn't seem to set up the permissions correctly.
This is an issue and `gpg` will gladly and loudly complain about it.

To fix it

<Steps>

1.  Make sure you are indeed the owner of `~/.gnupg`.

2.  After that simply correct the wrong permissions

    ```sh
    chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
    chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
    chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
    chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol
    ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">

I experienced some problems, especially trying to use `ssh` with `gpg-agent`, in the following chapters.
`gpg` can almost always be fixed with a

```sh
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye
```

but `ssh` still seems to be trying to use a GUI pinentry (e.g. `pinentry-gtk`),
probably because the `DISPLAY` environment variables are configured in WSL by default.
`pinentry-gtk` is disfunctional at this point, though, as it needs the [gtk3](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/gtk3/) dependency.

So make sure, you follow the [GUI](/DustWSL/ref/gui) chapter, to make sure WSLg works correctly, and install the GTK dependency
