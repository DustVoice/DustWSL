title: Register the Smartcard

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The final thing to do now, is to register the smartcard and the key to `gpg`.

The easiest way for me, since I have set the _URL of public key_ attribute on my YubiKey, is to

<Steps>

1. Edit the _card_

   ```sh
   gpg --card-edit
   ```

2. Fetch the public key from the URL

   ```sh frame="terminal" title="gpg/card>"
   fetch
   ```

3. Quit out of the prompt

   ```sh frame="terminal" title="gpg/card>"
   quit
   ```

4. Edit the _key_ / key associated with your **e-mail**

   ```sh "info@dustvoice.de"
   gpg --edit-key info@dustvoice.de
   ```

5. Give the key ultimate (`5`) trust, as you should be the key owner, and confirm it with `y`

   ```sh frame="terminal" title="gpg>"
   trust
   5
   y
   ```

6. Save the changes and quit the prompt.

   ```sh frame="terminal" title="gpg>"
   save
   ```

</Steps>
