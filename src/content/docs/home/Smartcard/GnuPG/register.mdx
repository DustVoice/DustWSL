title: Register the Smartcard
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The final thing to do now, is to register the smartcard and the key to `gpg`.

The easiest way for me, since I have set the _URL of public key_ attribute on my YubiKey, is to

<Steps>

1. `edit` the card

   ```sh
   gpg --card-edit
   ```

2. `fetch` the public key from the URL

   ```sh frame="terminal" title="gpg/card>"
   fetch
   ```

3. `quit` the `card-edit`

4. `edit` the key

   ```sh
   gpg --edit-key info@dustvoice.de
   ```

5. `trust` it ultimately (option `5`), as it's my own key, and confirm it with `y`

   ```sh frame="terminal" title="gpg>"
   trust
   5
   y
   ```

6. `save` the changes and quit the prompt.

</Steps>
