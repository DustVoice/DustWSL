title: SSH

As I'm almost exclusively using `gpg-agent` for SSH (except some cases where I use FIDO2 and resident keys),
as a substitute for `ssh-agent`, I have to set it up, so other applications can connect to it.

For that we mainly have to `unset` `SSH_AGENT_PID` and `set` `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.
This is best done in our `~/.bashrc`

```sh title=~/.bashrc ins={1,3-5}
unset SSH_AGENT_PID

if [ "${gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by:-0}" -ne $$ ]; then
  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)"
fi
```

<Aside type="tip">

As we want to use `git` over `ssh` in a second anyway, we can test if everything worked by trying to connect to GitHub
(of course, you already need `ssh` to be setup for your GitHub account)

```sh
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Dotfiles

Now that SSH is working just fine, we can switch the remote of the dotfiles repo over to use SSH.

```sh title=~/dotfiles
jj git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DustVoice/dotfiles.git
```

A simple

```sh
jj git fetch
```

should now succeed without any issues.
