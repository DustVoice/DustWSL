As I'm almost exclusively using `gpg-agent` for SSH (except some cases where I use FIDO2 and resident keys),
as a substitute for `ssh-agent`, I have to set it up, so other applications can connect to it.

For that we mainly have to `unset` `SSH_AGENT_PID` and `set` `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.
This is best done in our appropriate init file

<TabItem label="Nushell">

Nothing to do, since it's already included in my dotfile's `~/.bash_profile`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Xonsh">

```python title=~/.config/xonsh/user.xsh ins={1-2,4-5}
if "SSH_AGENT_PID" in ${...}:
    del $SSH_AGENT_PID

if ($gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by if "gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by" in ${...} else 0) != os.getpid():
    $SSH_AUTH_SOCK = $(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
```

<Aside type="tip">

As we want to use `git` over `ssh` in a second anyway, we can test if everything worked by trying to connect to GitHub
(of course, you already need `ssh` to be setup for your GitHub account)

```sh
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Dotfiles

Now that SSH is working just fine, we can switch the remote of the dotfiles repo over to use SSH.

<Tabs syncKey="vc">

<TabItem label="native">

```sh
chezmoi git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DustVoice/dotfiles.git
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="jujutsu">

```sh title=~/.local/share/chezmoi
jj git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DustVoice/dotfiles.git
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

A simple

<Tabs syncKey="vc">

<TabItem label="native">

```sh
chezmoi update
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="jujutsu">

```sh title=~/.local/share/chezmoi
jj git fetch
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

should now succeed without any issues.
