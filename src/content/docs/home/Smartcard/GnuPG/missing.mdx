<Card title="Required" icon="puzzle">

[ccid](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/ccid/)
[pcsclite](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pcsclite/)

</Card>

In my case the smartcard wasn't immediately available to `gpg`, despite it clearly showing up in `lsusb`.

You can check this with

```sh
gpg --card-status
```

This command _should_ output some information about the present smartcard.
If the output looks like the desert scene out of an old western movie, it's probably not being recognized correctly.

With WSL, `gnupg` apparently can't simply access the device,
which would normally be made possible by installing [`libusb-compat`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libusb-compat/).

To use the smartcard, we need to install [`pcsclite`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pcsclite/), which manages the smartcard,
as well as [`ccid`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/ccid/), which is a generic CCID driver.

```sh
paru -S pcsclite ccid
```

Then we _enable_ and _start_ the `pcscd` socket and service, which means it will be started, whenever needed

```sh
sudo systemctl enable pcscd
sudo systemctl start pcscd
```

As described in the Arch Wiki page about [GnuPG](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GnuPG#Using_a_smart_card_on_a_remote_client) however,
forwarding the smartcard to WSL will most likely throw errors.

Following the wiki on how to fix this, we simply add a new `polkit` rule to allow all users of the `wheel` group
(which our user is a part of), access to the smartcard.
The `polkit` rules are written in JavaScript and I chose to put this rule in `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/99-pcscd.rules`.

```js title=/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/99-pcscd.rules showLineNumbers
polkit.addRule(function (action, subject) {
  if (
    action.id == "org.debian.pcsc-lite.access_card" &&
    subject.isInGroup("wheel")
  ) {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});
polkit.addRule(function (action, subject) {
  if (
    action.id == "org.debian.pcsc-lite.access_pcsc" &&
    subject.isInGroup("wheel")
  ) {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});
```

Restart the `polkit.service`

```sh
sudo systemctl restart polkit.service
```

or even better, restart WSL (only restarting `polkit` didn't work for me)

<Steps>
1. ```sh
   exit
   ```

2. ```ps
   wsl.exe --shutdown
   arch.exe
   ```

</Steps>

In my case, it was still trying to connect to the smartcard using the integrated `ccid`,
so I needed to disable it by modifying/creating `~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf`

```txt title=~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf ins={1}
disable-ccid
```

<Aside type="tip">
If you still struggle with WSL recognizing the smartcard,
you could try the `pcsc_scan` utility from the [`pcsc-tools`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pcsc-tools/) package.

If you still have outstanding permission issues, try running it with `sudo`
to at least confirm the `usbipd` part worked, although after adding the
`polkit` rule and a WSL restart, `pcsc_scan` should work as a normal user.

You can also check what `gpg-agent` is doing with

```sh
systemctl --user status gpg-agent
```
