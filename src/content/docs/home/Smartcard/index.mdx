In order to really finish setting up my dotfiles, I need to have access to my Yubico YubiKey from within WSL.

Previously (especially with WSL v1), this was an absolute pain in the butt!
With WSL2 and better support overall, it's actually not that bad.

To use this, we will use `usbip`, which basically forwards USB over IP/Network, as the name implies.
Forwarding or sharing sockets, or similar, is an absolute nightmare, so this enables a quick and easy operation.

The only downside is that the device won't be available on Windows anymore.
This is either the case _while the device is attached_, or even _as long as it's bound_ (see below for further explanation).
This I can live with, as my whole development environment lives within WSL anyways.
