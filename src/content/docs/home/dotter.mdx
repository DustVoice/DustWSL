To manage my dotfiles, I'm currently using [dotter](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter).

For `dotter` to work correctly, we first need to create a `local.toml` config file
in the TOML format, to tell it which package groups we want and if we need a special config
(e.g. for Windows).
This file needs to be in the `.dotter` dir within the newly cloned dotfile repository.

I will enable both the **dev** as well as the **dev-extra** package within my config:

```toml title=~/dotfiles/.dotter/local.toml showLineNumbers
packages = ["dev", "dev-extra"]
```

<Aside type="tip">

As we neither have an editor, nor a special shell setup yet, the easiest way to do it is probably using

```sh
echo packages = ["dev", "dev-extra"] > ~/dotfiles/.dotter/local.toml
```

</Aside>

After that, a simple

```sh
dotter deploy
```

within the `dotfiles` repo should do the rest of the magic.
