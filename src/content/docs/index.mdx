This guide is an attempt at providing a guide for my [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) setup based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), or rather [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL).

It is mainly intended as a set of personal mental crutches, so the following disclaimer applies

<Aside type="danger">

- Your mileage may vary!
- Not for the faint of heart!
- Be wary of utter steaming hot garbage!
- Proceed with caution and at your own risk!

</Aside>

I segmented this guide into multiple parts for better structuring

## Syntactic Sugar

Throughout this document I use some special elements to make it easier for the reader to retrieve information at a glance.

### Packages

At the beginning of a chapter, I sometimes include a list of packages.
This is an accumulated list of packages mentioned throughout this chapter.
It makes it easier to see which packages are supposed to be installed, so nothing is forgotten.
Mandatory or strongly suggested packages are checked, optional ones are not.

<Card title="Optional" icon="puzzle">

### Asides

I use [Asides](https://starlight.astro.build/components/asides/)
in some places to provide some additional notes, comments, tips or warnings.

<Aside>
  Highlights information that users should take into account, even when
  skimming.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
  Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  Optional information to help a user be more successful.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">Negative potential consequences of an action.</Aside>

### Terminal and Code blocks

I try to enhance the code blocks with some useful information, such as language/fileformat, filename, etc.

Executing a command within Windows, for example, will normally be marked by a block,
highlighted with `PowerShell`-specific syntax

```powershell
Get-Language
which.exe wsl
```

Executing a command from within WSL will be marked by a normal terminal frame.
An optional directory to run the commmand in, can also be specified

```bash frame="terminal" title="~/dotfiles"
ls -la | grep ".el"
```

If a file or code snippet is written in a specific language,
it will be also highlighted appropriately

```rust
println!("Hello world");
```

A text file also has its appropriate symbol.
A filepath can optionally be specified, same as with a code snippet.

```txt title=~/log.txt
[INFO:] Test
```
