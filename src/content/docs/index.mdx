This guide is an attempt at providing a guide for my [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) setup based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), or rather [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL).

It is mainly intended as a set of personal mental crutches, so the following disclaimer applies

<Aside type="danger">

- Your mileage may vary!
- Not for the faint of heart!
- Be wary of utter steaming hot garbage!
- Proceed with caution and at your own risk!

I segmented this guide into multiple topics for better structuring
