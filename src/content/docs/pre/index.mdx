In this part we are mainly concerned about setting up WSL in general.

For that we need to do a bit of configuration outside and inside the WSL environment.

<Steps>

1. <LinkCard title="WSL" description="Set up the WSL kernel" href="./pre/wsl" />

2. <LinkCard
     title="ArchWSL"
     description="Set up the ArchWSL distro"
     href="./pre/archwsl"
   />

</Steps>
