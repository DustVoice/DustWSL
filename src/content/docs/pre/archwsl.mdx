When in doubt, use the [ArchWSL documentation](https://wsldl-pg.github.io/ArchW-docs/).

</Aside>

For me, the simplest procedure to install the Distro was to

<Steps>

1.  Download the latest `Arch.zip` file from the [project's release page](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL/releases/latest)
2.  Extract it to a folder where your user has unrestricted read/write permissions (so ideally stay away from `Program Files`, etc.)
3.  Run the included `Arch.exe`
4.  Change the root password

    ```sh
    passwd
    ```

5.  Add the `wheel` group to the allowed `sudo` users

    ```sh
    echo "%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/wheel
    ```

6.  Choose a username for your new user

    ```sh
    export username={username}
    ```

    and add this new user to the `wheel` group

    ```sh
    useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash $username
    ```

7.  Change the new user's password

    ```sh
    passwd $username
    ```

8.  Exit the WSL environment

    ```sh
    exit
    ```

9.  Set the new user as the default one

    ```ps
    Arch.exe config --default-user {username}
    ```

10. Reboot the PC or alternatively restart `LxssManager` with

    ```ps
    net stop lxssmanager
    net start lxssmanager
    ```

11. After that reenter WSL with

    ```ps
    Arch.exe
    ```

12. Setup the `pacman` keyring

    ```sh
    sudo pacman-key --init
    sudo pacman-key --populate
    sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
    ```

13. Update the base system

    ```sh
    sudo pacman -Su
    ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">

You can update your mirrorlist with your nearest mirrors.

<Steps>

1.  Backup your original mirrorlist.

    ```sh
    sudo cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
    ```

2.  Generate a mirrorlist and save it to `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`

    ```sh
    curl -s "https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=DE&protocol=http&protocol=https&ip_version=4&use_mirror_status=on" \
    | sudo tee /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
    ```

3.  Uncomment desired lines in `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` and move them to the top

</Steps>

Alternatively you can automatically pick the 5 best mirrors and save them,
although you need the `pacman-contrib` package installed for the `rankmirrors` command.

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu pacman-contrib
curl -s "https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=DE&protocol=http&protocol=https&ip_version=4&use_mirror_status=on" \
| sed -e 's/^#Server/Server/' -e '/^#/d' \
| rankmirrors -n 5 - \
| sudo tee /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

### Just Works<sup>TM</sup>? <Badge text="Special" variant="tip" />

<Aside>

This should only be neccessary if you're behind a (corporate) `http` proxy.

</Aside>

As I'm sitting behind a corporate `http` proxy, I initially had no access to the internet.

This can be confirmed by running

```sh
curl https://archlinux.org
```

To make WSL proxy-aware, I needed to

<Steps>

1.  Add the exports to the `~/.bashrc` with

    ```bash title="~/.bashrc" ins={1-3} "<hostname>" "<port>"
    export http_proxy=http://<hostname>:<port>
    export https_proxy=$http_proxy
    export ftp_proxy=$http_proxy
    ```

    <Tabs syncKey="shell">

    <TabItem label="Xonsh">

    Preemptively add the environment variables to `~/.config/xonsh/env.xsh`

    ```python title="~/.config/xonsh/env.xsh" ins={1-3} "<hostname>" "<port>"
    $http_proxy = "http://<hostname>:<port>"
    $https_proxy = $http_proxy
    $ftp_proxy = $http_proxy
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Nushell">

    Nothing more to do, as nushell will get invoked through `~/.bashrc`

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

2.  Source it

    ```sh
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

3.  Allow `sudo` to pass these environment variables through by
    setting the `env_keep` property in `/etc/sudoers.d/proxy`

    ```txt title="/etc/sudoers.d/proxy" ins={1}
    Defaults env_keep += "http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy"
    ```

</Steps>

Rerunning the `curl`-command should now produce a response and `pacman` should update and upgrade just fine:

```sh
sudo pacman -Syyuu
```
