import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem, Icon } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Of course, one would need to be able to edit this Guide to update it.

I use [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build),
which in turn is based on [Astro](https://astro.build).

As a package manager, I currently use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).
Below are the commands for package managers I am using / have used in the past.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">

| Command                     | Action                                                         |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`              | Installs dependencies + creates backup `yarn.lock`             |

| `pnpm astro ...`            | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check`, `astro sync` |
| `pnpm dlx @astrojs/upgrade` | Update Starlight and therefore Astro, etc.                     |

<Aside type="tip">

If you omit `--bun`, bun will run the command using `node` instead of `bun`,
which in my case made it work under Windows.
