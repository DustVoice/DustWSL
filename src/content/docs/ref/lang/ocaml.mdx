<Steps>

1.  Make sure the dependencies are installed, as listed in the package list.

2.  Install `opam`

    ```sh
    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh)"
    ```

3.  Init opam

    ```sh
    opam init
    ```

4.  When prompted where to put the integration, which defaults to `.bash_profile`,
    change it to another path and append the contents to your `.bashrc`

    ```bash title="~/.bashrc" ins={1-7} "<username>"
    # BEGIN opam configuration
    # This is useful if you're using opam as it adds:
    #   - the correct directories to the PATH
    #   - auto-completion for the opam binary
    # This section can be safely removed at any time if needed.
    test -r '/home/<username>/.opam/opam-init/init.sh' && . '/home/<username>/.opam/opam-init/init.sh' > /dev/null 2> /dev/null || true
    # END opam configuration
    ```

5.  Install the devtools

    ```sh
    opam install ocaml-lsp-server odoc ocamlformat utop
    ```
