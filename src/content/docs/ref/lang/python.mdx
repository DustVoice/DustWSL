There is no denying it, python is one of the most popular programming languages.
And although I hate the syntax until the day I die (come at me, but indentation as syntax is a mistake),
the shier amount of packages, tools, libraries, APIs, yada yada, makes it extremely flexible and versatile.

<Aside>

For example for generating 3D models programmatically,
[CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery?tab=readme-ov-file) is the most viable contender for me,
especially considering I don't want to suffer from [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) induced vomiting.

</Aside>

Not giving up on my lispy dreams though, I'm trying out [Hy](https://hylang.org) here and there, too.

## Setup

Normally installing python is as simple as installing the package.

### System Packages vs. pip

Installing packages globally through `pip` isn't the most optimal thing,
especially when using it in a development environment.

It is [generally preferred](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Python#Arch_Repositories) to install the specific package through the official repositories or AUR,
where the package name often follows the `python-<package_name>` scheme.

### miniforge

Another way is to utilize virtual environments.

I personally prefer using [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), which provides the `conda` and `mamba` commands, among others.

- [python-conda](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-conda/) is too bloated for me
- [miniconda3](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/miniconda3/) uses the _Anaconda Inc._ channel

I prefer the community supported `conda-forge` channel, though, which miniforge uses by default and exclusively.
Furthermore, miniforge is installed in userspace, so it marks a clear separation of a virtual environment to the system installation.

<Steps>

1.  Download the latest installer script from the [download page](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest),
    or using your preferred shell

    <Tabs syncKey="shell">

    <TabItem label="Xonsh">

    ```python title="~" frame="terminal"
    wget -O Miniforge3.sh @("https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-" + $(uname) + "-" + $(uname -m) + ".sh")
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="nushell">

    ```nushell title="~" frame="terminal"
    wget -O Miniforge3.sh $"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-(uname | get kernel-name)-(uname | get machine).sh"
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

2.  Run the script through `bash`

    ```sh title="~" frame="terminal"
    bash Miniforge3.sh
    ```

3.  Choose **no** when prompted whether you want to update your shell configuration or not (doesn't work for nushell).

4.  Add miniforge's `bin` directory to your `$PATH`

    <Tabs syncKey="shell">

    <TabItem label="Xonsh">

    ```python title="~/.config/xonsh/env.xsh" ins={1} "~/miniforge3/bin"
    $PATH.prepend("~/miniforge3/bin")
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Nushell">

    ```bash title="~/.bashrc" ins={1} "$HOME/miniforge3/bin"
    export PATH="$HOME/miniforge3/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

5.  Close and reopen WSL (so the init file gets sourced), or temporarily add miniforge to you path

    <Tabs syncKey="shell">

    <TabItem label="Xonsh">

    ```python
    $PATH.prepend("~/miniforge3/bin")
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Nushell">

    ```nu
    $env.PATH = ($env.PATH | append $"($env.HOME)/miniforge3/bin")
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

6.  <Tabs syncKey="shell">

    <TabItem label="Xonsh">

    Init conda

    ```sh title="~" frame="terminal"
    conda init
    ```

    <Aside>

    This will write the `conda init` specific code to `~/.xonshrc`.
    The `~/.config/xonsh/rc.xsh` included with my dotfiles takes precedence over it,
    but my custom config sources `~/.xonshrc` so conda can effortlessly modify the file as needed.

    </Aside>

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Nushell">

    Make sure the conda plugin for `nu` works correctly

    ```sh title="~" frame="terminal"
    conda activate
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

7.  Remove the installation script

    ```sh title="~" frame="terminal"
    rm Miniforge3.sh
    ```

</Steps>

Now when you want to activate an environment, you can simply use

<Tabs syncKey="shell">

<TabItem label="Xonsh">

```sh "<name>"
conda activate <name>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Nushell">

```sh "<name>"
conda activate <name>
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
