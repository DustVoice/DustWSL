I currently use [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) directly from within WSL.

Therefore I also need to install my currently used font package [Iosevka (Term)](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) inside WSL,
otherwise Ghostty will fallback to its included [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font.

Installing the other mentioned fonts is optional,
these are just interesting fonts I have tried out for a longer period of time previously.

Previously, I used Wezterm installed on Windows,
but as I transitioned to use chezmoi for my dotfile management (see the [Dotfiles](/DustWSL/home/dotfiles/) chapter),
I currently don't have a great workflow for deploying my dotfiles on Windows.

For me, personally, this isn't a problem, as I grew fond of having my complete setup in WSL.
Managing two systems and keeping ontop of everything is honestly simply too taxing.

If you want to use Wezterm, I would recommend using it from the Windows side,
utilizing its feature of directly attaching to WSL, instead of using it from within WSL, however.
I encountered multiple bugs, like the inability to maximize, for example, that made it a PITA to use from _within_ WSL.
