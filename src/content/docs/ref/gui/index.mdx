Some time ago, you would need to have a complicated, convoluted and unreliable setup
for using GUI apps within WSL.
Thankfully, we now have [WSLg](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg),
which transforms this whole ordeal into a non-pain-in-the-butt experience.

## Wayland & X11

If you use the "official" Distribution, i.e. Ubuntu, it should also work out of the box.
As we use ArchWSL, we have to setup the correct symlinks though.

<Steps>

1.  The environment variables should already be _automagically_ setup to the correct values at this point.

    ```nu
    $env.WAYLAND_DISPLAY = 'wayland-0'
    $env.DISPLAY = ':0'
    ```

2.  Everything we need, should already be in `/mnt/wslg`, namely `runtime-dir` and `.X11-unix`

3.  Create a `systemd` service that setups the Wayland runtime directory

    ```systemd title="/etc/systemd/user/wslg-runtime-dir.service" showLineNumbers
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=sh -c "ln -fs /mnt/wslg/runtime-dir/* "%t

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```

4.  Create a `systemd` service that setups the X11 socket

    ```systemd title="/etc/systemd/user/wslg-X11-unix.service" showLineNumbers
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStartPre=rm -rf /tmp/.X11-unix
    ExecStart=ln -s /mnt/wslg/.X11-unix /tmp/.X11-unix

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```

5.  Enable those services

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl --global enable wslg-runtime-dir
    sudo systemctl --global enable wslg-X11-unix
    ```

6.  Restart WSL

    ```sh
    exit
    ```

    ```ps
    wsl.exe --shutdown
    arch.exe
    ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">

You can test both Wayland and X11 functionality with the `wev` and `xev` commands respectively.

## OpenGL

For me it seem that installing [mesa](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/mesa/) was enough to make e.g. CadQuery run without problems.

<Aside type="tip">

To test if OpenGL works, you can use the `glxinfo` and/or `glxgears` commands included in [mesa-utils](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/mesa-utils/).
