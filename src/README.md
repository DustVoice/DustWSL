This document is an attempt at providing a guide for my [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) setup based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), or rather [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL).

It is mainly intended as a set of personal mental crutches, so the following disclaimer applies
